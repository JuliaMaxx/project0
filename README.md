## Description:
The goal was to recreate Google's main page as closely as possible, while also adding some personal touches to the design
### Specification:
- There are three types of searches you can make on the website:
  - Google Search
  - Google Image Search
  - Google Advanced Search
- Search functionality is consistent with Google's own
- When you type in your query you are taken to the Google's results for that page
- "I'm feeling lucky" button is consistent with Googleâ€™s behavior as well,
  clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query.
